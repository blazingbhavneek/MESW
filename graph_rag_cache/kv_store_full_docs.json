But Without Explicit Mention, Perhaps \"Lines\" Should Be Skipped. Let Me Check Again. The Original Text Says \"A Circuit Breaker Between The Generator And Its Bus.\" So \"Lines\" Here Is The Circuit Breaker. So \"Term: Circuit Breaker\" And \"Definition: A Circuit Breaker Between The Generator And Its Bus.\"**\nDefinition: a circuit breaker between the generator and its bus.\" That matches. Similarly, \"lines\" might refer to the physical connections. But the user's instruction says to use only the terms present in the context. Since \"lines\" isn't explicitly mentioned, maybe it's better to skip. However, the user's example includes \"circuit breaker\", so maybe \"lines\" is intended here. Alternatively, maybe \"lines\" refers to the generator and bus. But without explicit mention, perhaps \"lines\" should be skipped. Let me check again. The original text says \"a circuit breaker between the generator and its bus.\" So \"lines\" here is the circuit breaker. So \"TERM: circuit breaker\" and \"DEFINITION: a circuit breaker between the generator and its bus.\"."

Convert this document to a modern ebook format, such as AZW3 for Kindles or EPUB for other ebook readers, to see it in action. There is support for images, tables, lists, footnotes, endnotes, links, dropcaps and various types of text and paragraph level formatting. To see the DOCX conversion in action, simply add this file to calibre using the “Add Books” button and then click “Convert”. Set the output format in the top right corner of the conversion dialog to EPUB or AZW3 and click “OK”. Footer"

Here is some bold, italic, bold-italic, underlined and struck out text. Then, we have a superscript and a sub . Now we see some red, green and blue text. Some text script with a yellow highlight. Some text in a box. Some text in inverse video. A paragraph with styled text: subtle emphasis followed by strong text and intense emphasis. This paragraph uses document wide styles for styling rather than inline text properties as demonstrated in the previous paragraph — calibre can handle both with equal ease."

It has also been given a light gray background. For the lovers of poetry amongst you, paragraphs with hanging indents, like this often come in handy. You can use hanging indents to ensure that a line of poetry retains its individual identity as a line even when the screen is too narrow to display it as a single line. Not only does this paragraph have a hanging indent, it is also has an extra top margin, setting it apart from the preceding paragraph. Footer"

Note that for optimum results, when creating tables in Word, you should set their widths using percentages, rather than absolute units. To the left of this paragraph is a floating two column table with a nice green border and header row. Now let’s look at a fancier table—one with alternating row colors and partial borders. This table is stretched out to take 100% of the available width.

Because of limitations in ebook technology, this is not possible when converting. Instead, the converted drop cap will use font size and line height to simulate the effect as well as possible. While not as good as the original, the result is usually tolerable. This paragraph has a “D” dropcap set to occupy three lines of text with a font size of 58.5 pts. Depending on the screen width and capabilities of the device you view the book on, this dropcap can look anything from perfect to ugly."

Provided that the Table of Contents uses hyperlinks, calibre will automatically use it. The levels of the Table of Contents are identified by their left indent, so if you want the ebook to have a multi-level Table of Contents, make sure you create a properly indented Table of Contents in Word. If no Table of Contents is found in the document, then a table of contents is automatically generated from the headings in the document. A heading is identified as something that has the Heading 1 or Heading 2, etc. style applied to it. These 1 In paged media, footnotes are usually displayed at the bottom of the text. However, in ebooks, a better paradigm is to make them clickable endnotes that the user can browse at her pleasure. This conversion is handled automatically by calibre. Footer"

    "content": "# Images\n\nImages can be of three main types. Inline images are images that are part of the normal text flow, like this image of a green dot . Inline images do not cause breaks in the text and are usually small in size. The next category of image is a floating image, one that “floats “ on the page and is surrounded by text. Word supports more types of floating images than are possible with current ebook technology, so the conversion maps floating images to simple left and right floats, as you can see with the left and right arrow images on the sides of this paragraph. The final type of image is a “block” image, one that becomes a paragraph on its own and has no text on either side. Below is a centered green dot. Centered images like this are useful for large pictures that should be a focus of attention. Generally, it is not possible to translate the exact positioning of images from a Word document to an ebook. That is because in Word, image positioning is specified in absolute units from the page boundaries. There is no analogous technology in ebooks, so the conversion will usually end up placing the image either centered or floating close to the point in the text where it was inserted, not necessarily where it appears on the page in Word.
